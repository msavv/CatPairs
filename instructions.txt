Thank you for checking out my CatPairs game!

This is a game where you can select the number of players from 2 to 20,
and the number of cards from 1 (why would you) to 20.
You can also name yourselves! If you don't want to, you will get 
generic Player 1, Player 2, etc. names.
When you have chosen the number of players, cards and your names, you can start the game.

The game will have a square-shaped grid where the buttons will be placed as nicely
as possible, but they won't always fill the whole area. It's not possible 
to insert 10 cards into a nice square shape, for example.

Anyways, you can click a card and it will turn and you will see a nice cat picture. Then
you have to find it's pair. If you don't succeed on the first try, don't worry, The cards
will turn back after a short delay, and it will be the next players turn. If you do succeed,
you will get a point, the cards will disappear and you will have another try too!

When you have found all the cards, the game will congratulate you and tell you who's the 
winner or if there was a tie situation. You can then choose to play another game or quit the game.

You can actually start a new game at all times, except when you have a card open.
You can quit the game at any time you want.

At all times you can see at the right side a timer that tells you how much time has passed since
the start of the current game, a text that tells whose turn it is and how many points they have, 
a text that welcomes you, encourages you and congratulates you :)!

I hope this text was enough to get you started! Have fun!
For more technical information, keep reading.

The MainWindow is a QT object which contains the neccessary buttons, grids and labels.
At the beginning of each game, it initializes a GameEngine-object, which then initializes
the needed amount of player-objects.
The player objects have names and points, and the GameEngine-object modifies and reads them.
I used my previous Pairs -project as a template for the Player-class and GameEngine-class.

They are used on the MainWindow to keep track of the points of the players, and of when 
the last pair has been claimed.

The MainWindow unfortunately combines the use of QT Design and writing the GUI-code manually, as I was bit lost on both
of those ways. I found it better for me to use QT Design, but for creating just the rigth sized cardbuttons, I had to 
insert them manually on the grid. All other buttons and labels are created on QT Design, which got a bit cluttered, but
they're still there.

I feel like the MainWindow is pretty straight-forward, as I lined up the functions in order as they happen and commented
them well.

There are three different "views", the greetingsBox, which has the introduction and settings for the game, the buttonsBox
which contains the cardbuttons and where the main game happens, and the congratsBox which comes up when the game is won.
They call eachother in order and edit themselves to be hidden or visible when neccessary. GameEngine is used when it is 
useful, but a lot of the programs functionality happens in the GUI as the boxes go so well together.


The program is throughoutly commented, so I hope you will find more of the technical details from there.

Extra features for Bonus points:
-Figures on faces of the cards (20p)
-Figure on the back of the cards (10p)
-Variable number of players (10p)
-New game button shown at all times (10p)
-Time used so far shown during the game (10p)

Together they are 60p, but maximum is 50p, hope I will get close to 50 at least.
